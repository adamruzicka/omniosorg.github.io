**Naming convention change:** When a release passes its 26-week mark and
a new stable release is out, further weekly releases will move to a
week-number scheme, picking up with week 27. This will persist as long
as the release is receiving updates, according to the
[release cycle](http://wiki.omniosce.org/ReleaseCycle.html).

  with upgrade to r151008. Must be applied to both global zone and any non-global
  zones prior to upgrade

Now that r151008 is released, users wishing to stay on r151006, which is
an LTS release, should freeze the incorporation packages at 0.151006 as
noted in the [Admin Guide](http://wiki.omniosce.org/GeneralAdministration.html#StayingOnARelease).

## r151006c

Weekly release for 13-17 May 2013

Even though r151006 was delayed, we are sticking to the planned release
schedule, which assumed a release for the week of 29 April - 3 May. This
way the release of r151008 will not be delayed as a consequence, and it
makes this week “c”.

Bug fixes:

* Updated kernel (**REBOOT REQUIRED**) - [illumos #3769](https://www.illumos.org/issues/3769)
  fixes the implementation of SOCK_NONBLOCK and implements SOCK_NDELAY to match accept4().
  * Affects: `system/kernel`, `system/kernel/platform`, `system/library`
  * Note: the changes in `system/library` are documentation only, no ABI change
  * Updates may be applied without detaching non-global zones, though we recommend that
    zones still be shut down during the update process. Zones attached to the system during
    this update will get a new ZFS dataset that matches the global zone's new BE
  * After booting into the new BE, shut down the non-global zone again and run   
    ```
    pkg -R <zonepath>/root update
    ```
    where `<zonepath>` is the value of the zonepath attribute in the zone's configuration.
    Doing it this way is required because the `system/library` package normally requires a
    new BE, which can't be done from within a non-global zone
  * After applying this update, `/etc/motd` will still show the original release hash
    (omnios-8d266aa), but `uname -v` will now show **omnios-d3950d8**, indicating the updated kernel
* `service/network/ntp` - SMF manifest fix to allow ntpd to raise its own scheduling priority,
  thereby providing more consistent clock adjustments. (https://github.com/omniti-labs/omnios-build/issues/14)
* `storage/storage-server` - Remove dependency on `library/samba/libsmbclient`, which is not part
  of illumos-gate and not shipped by OmniOS
* `system/install/kayak-kernel` - Fix missing miniroot.gz and pxegrub files

Updated packages:

* `system/pciutils/pci.ids` - updated to 2013-05-13 snapshot
