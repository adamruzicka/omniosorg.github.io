## r151002f

Weekly release for 7-11 May 2012

* Security fixes
  * OpenSSL 1.0.1c ([advisory](http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20120510.txt))
* Removed packages
  * image/library/libjpeg
  * image/library/libpng
  * image/library/libtiff
  * library/print/cups-libs
  * library/print/lcms2
  * print/cups
  * print/filter/ghostscript
  * system/library/fontconfig
  * system/library/freetype-2
    * Furthering our minimalism goal, we have removed dependencies on
      Ghostscript and CUPS. This breaks CUPS support in smbd (spool).
      If we decide we want to enable that, we should only require the
      cups header to build and should consider packaging that in
      illumos-gate
    * Note that these packages are not defined in the “entire” incorporation
      so typical installs would not have any of these packages. They would only
      have been installed if you were building the OS‚‘
* New packages
  * `system/install/kayak` : Kayak network installer system
  * `system/install/kayak-kernel` : Kayak boot kernel and miniroot
