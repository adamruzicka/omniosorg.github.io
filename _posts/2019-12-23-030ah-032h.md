OmniOS Community Edition weekly releases for w/c 23rd of December 2019 are
now available.

For all supported OmniOS releases, OpenSSL 1.0 has been updated to 1.0.2u,
which includes a security fix. This is expected to be the last update for the
1.0 series which reaches end of support on the 31st of December 2019.

**OmniOS r151030 and above** already include OpenSSL 1.1 as the default version
with 1.0 libraries delivered alongside for backwards compatibility. The
currently selected default version an be checked using `pkg mediator` -
check that _1.1_ appears in the _VERSION_ column.

```
# pkg mediator openssl
MEDIATOR VER. SRC. VERSION IMPL. SRC. IMPLEMENTATION
openssl  vendor    1.1     vendor
```

To change the default version to 1.1, if necessary, use:

```
# pkg unset-mediator openssl
```

Additionally, for **r151032 only**:

* The beta UEFI 2.7 firmware for bhyve has been updated and should now work
  with more systems. This firmware can be selected by setting the bootrom zone
  attribute to BHYVE_RELEASE-beta.
