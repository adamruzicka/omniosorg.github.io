title: OmniOS Community Edition r151038v, r151036av, r151030dv
synopsis: OmniOS r151038v, r151036av and r151030dv updates
---
OmniOS r151038v, r151036av and r151030dv are now available.

### In all of the above releases:

* OpenSSH has been updated, fixing
  [CVE-2021-41617](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-41617).

### In r151036 and r151038

* If the system dump device was configured on a ZVOL on a RAIDZ pool, then
  a system panic could cause unrelated corruption on the pool.

### In r151038 only

* bhyve now supports virtio-9p (aka VirtFS) filesystem sharing to guests.
  This is configured through the new `virtfs[N]` zone attribute as described
  in [bhyve(5)](https://man.omnios.org/bhyve.5).

* bhyve guests could fail to boot on some older AMD machines; this was a
  regression from previous OmniOS releases.

* Several improvements have been made to the viona network driver used by
  bhyve.

* Performance of the system console has been significantly improved.

* The `update-man-index` service which re-indexes manual pages at boot and
  after package operations has been optimised so that it only rebuilds the
  required indices.

* The gcc10 package has been updated to match the published illumos
  gcc-10.3.0-il-1 tag.
