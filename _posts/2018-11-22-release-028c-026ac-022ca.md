synopsis: Weekly releases - openssl security update
---
OmniOS Community Edition weekly releases for w/c 19th of November 2018 are
now available. These are non-reboot updates.

In all releases:

* openssl has been updated to the latest release (1.0.2q in all and 1.1.0j
  in r151028), fixing two low severity CVEs.
* openjdk has been updated to 1.7.0_201-b00

In r151026 and r151028, `pkg` has been updated to fix a problem that could
occur when removing a package if auto-be-naming is enabled.

r151028 has also received an update to the `openssh` package to work around
a bug in VMware that could cause SSH traffic to be dropped, and a small update
to `system/header` to add a file that was missing.

This week also sees a backport to `screen` in r151022 so that it is built
against the more extensive ncurses library, enabling support for more terminal
types.
