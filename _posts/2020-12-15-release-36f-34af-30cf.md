---
OmniOS weekly releases for w/c 14th of December 2020 are now available.

## All supported OmniOS releases have been updated with the following changes:

### Security Fixes

* `openssl` updated to 1.1.1i, fixing
  [CVE-2020-1971](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20201208.txt)

* `openssl 1.0` updated to fix
  [CVE-2020-1968](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20200909.txt),
  [CVE-2020-1971](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20201208.txt)

* `curl` updated to 7.74.0, fixing
  [CVE-2020-8284](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2020-8284.html),
  [CVE-2020-8285](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2020-8285.html),
  [CVE-2020-8286](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2020-8286.html)

### Bug Fixes

* MacOS Big Sur clients would experience read hangs when accessing OmniOS
  SMB shares.

* The `pkg apply-hot-fix` command, in conjunction with the creation of a new
  boot environment, would sometimes leave extra origins configured in
  non-global zones. This caused problems for subsequent package updates.

* Compiling with `gcc -pg` did not produce a working profiling binary.

### Other Changes

* The Intel CPU microcode update for some Core (Gen. 11) Mobile processors
  has been removed as it was reported to cause problems on some platforms.

---

## Additionally in both the r151034 and r151036 releases:

* In rare cases, a system could crash shortly after boot while maintaining
  ZFS user quota information (particularly if a zfs recv was running at
  the same time).

## and in r151036 only:

* The `pciutils` package tools were unable to enumerate PCI devices.

* A file's modification time would change twice when the file was modified
  from an SMB client. This caused problems for some Windows utilities.

* Restore the NDMP ZFS backup and restore method which was inadvertently
  broken in the r151036 release.
