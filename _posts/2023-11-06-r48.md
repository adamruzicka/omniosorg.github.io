OmniOSce v11 r151048 is out!

On the 6th of November 2023, the OmniOSce Association has released a new stable
version of OmniOS - The Open Source Enterprise Server OS. The release comes
with many tool updates, brand-new features and additional hardware support. For
details see the [release notes](https://omnios.org/rn/r48).

**Note that r151044 is now end-of-life.** You should upgrade to r151046
or r151048 to stay on a supported track. r151046 is an LTS release with support
until May 2026, and r151048 is a stable release with support until November
2024.

For anyone who tracks LTS releases, the previous LTS - r151038 - now enters its
last six months. You should plan to upgrade to r151046 for continued LTS
support.

OmniOS is fully Open Source and free. Nevertheless, it takes a lot of time and
money to keep maintaining a full-blown operating system distribution. Our
statistics show that there are almost 2'000 active installations of OmniOS
while fewer than 20 people send regular contributions. If your organisation
uses OmniOS based servers, please consider becoming a regular
[patron](https://omnios.org/patron) or taking out a
[support contract](https://omnios.org/invoice).
