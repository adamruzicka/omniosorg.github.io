---
OmniOS weekly releases for w/c 20th of July 2020 are now available.

For **r151034 only**:

* Some 64-bit PCI devices were not programmed correctly
* The `mlxcx` driver has been updated to fix several problems
* Panic in `imc` driver on some systems with broken firmware
* LX: `/proc/<pid>/exe` symlink was not always present
* LX: Would occasionally see defunct processes with busy parents
* LX: Improve support for networking setup in Void linux zones
* loader could not read a ZFS pool which had a removed slog device
* vioblk devices could hang under memory pressure
* It was not possible to run bhyve in the global zone under a DEBUG kernel
   (although this is possible for testing, bhyve should always be run within a
    zone for proper protection)
* Added a `depend.ooceextra` facet to illumos packages to allow installation
   without reference to the omnios-extra repository
* Updated curl to 7.71.1

Additionally, the following packages have been updated for all supported releases:

* `openjdk` to to 1.8.0\_262
* `rsync` to 3.2.2
