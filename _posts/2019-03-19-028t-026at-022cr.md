OmniOS Community Edition weekly releases for w/c 18th of March 2019 are
now available.

The following fixes are available for all supported releases:

* The `network/ntp` package has been updated to version 4.2.8p13 addressing
  [one security vulnerability](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/SecurityNotice#Recent_Vulnerabilities).

In addition, for r151028 only:

* A new `system/network/cdp` package is available that provides a service
  that uses Cisco Discovery Protocol to advertise the local host to
  neighbouring switches, and to maintain a table of neighbours that can
  be viewed via `cdpadm show nei`. This new service was contributed by
  [Prominic.NET](https://prominic.net).
