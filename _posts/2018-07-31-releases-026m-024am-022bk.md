title: OmniOS Community Edition r151026m, r151024am & r151022bk
synopsis: Weekly releases including Meltdown for LTS/r151022
---

OmniOS Community Edition releases
r151026m, r151024am & r151022bk
are now available.

## r151026

### Bug Fixes

* [illumos Issue 7941](https://www.illumos.org/issues/7941)
  cannot use crypto lofi on a block/character device
* Newer versions of the iproute2 utilities fail in an lx zone
  with `('DONE truncated', 'Dump terminated')`

### Other Changes

* Automatic naming is now supported for boot environments created during
  package operations. This is configured via the new `auto-be-name` image
  property which specifies a template for the new name; see the man page for
  the `pkg` command for more information and examples. A suggested property
  value is `omnios-r%r` which results in BE names such as `omnios-r151026m`:

  ```
  # pkg set-property auto-be-name omnios-r%r
  # pkg update
  ...
  A clone of r151026 exists and has been updated and activated.
  On the next boot the Boot Environment omnios-r151026m will be
  mounted on '/'.  Reboot when ready to switch to this updated BE.
  ```

## r151024

* Newer versions of the iproute2 utilities fail in an lx zone
  with `('DONE truncated', 'Dump terminated')`
