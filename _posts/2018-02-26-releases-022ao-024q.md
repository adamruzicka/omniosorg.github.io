---

OmniOS Community Edition releases r151022ao & r151024q are now available.

Weekly releases for w/c 26th of February 2018.
> This update requires a reboot.

Both releases have received the following updates:

### Security fixes

* `GNU patch` updated to fix
  * [CVE-2018-6951](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2018-6951)

### Bug fixes

* Fix for time-of-day clock error
  [illumos issue 8680](https://www.illumos.org/issues/8680)
* Fix for broken ZFS ACL inheritance
  [illumos issue 8984](https://www.illumos.org/issues/8984)

> If you use ZFS ACLs (i.e. more than just the standard permissions set with
> `chmod`) and use ACL inheritance, then it is possible that this bug will
> have resulted in files with overly permissive permissions. To check a
> data-store for this problem, you can use a script similar to that at
> [https://downloads.omniosce.org/misc/8984-acl-check](https://downloads.omniosce.org/misc/8984-acl-check)
> If you need any help with this, please get in touch - see bottom of post
> for contact details.

### Enhancements

* New package command to easily install a hotfix from a local package
  archive or remote web site, for example:
```
% pfexec pkg apply-hot-fix --be-name=hotfix1234 \
    https://downloads.omniosce.org/pkg/r151022/1234_hotfix.p5p
```
