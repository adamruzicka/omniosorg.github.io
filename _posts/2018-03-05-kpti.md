title: Meltdown fix available for testing
synopsis: Meltdown fix available for testing
---

Thanks to the work done by Joyent on fixes for the
[Meltdown attack](https://meltdownattack.com/), we now have beta OmniOS
updates available for testing. These updates include the KPTI (and PCID)
work up to [Joyent's kpti-squash branch.](https://github.com/rmustacc/illumos-gate/commits/kpti-squash)

From Joyent:

The test update can be applied to a bloody system and will install into a new
boot-environment so that you can easily switch back and forth as required.

```
# pkg update pkg
# pkg apply-hot-fix --be-name=kpti https://downloads.omniosce.org/pkg/bloody/kpti.p5p
# init 6
```

## Useful commands

To check if you are running with KPTI enabled:
```
# echo kpti_enable/X | mdb -k
```

To check CPU features for PCID/INVPCID support:
```
# echo ::x86_featureset | mdb -k | grep -i pcid
```

To confirm PCID is being used (look for cr3 values starting with 0x8 as shown
below):
```
# echo "cpus::print cpu_t cpu_m.mcpu_kpti.kf_user_cr3" | mdb -k
cpu_m.mcpu_kpti.kf_user_cr3 = 0x8000000800083001
```
