title: OmniOS Community Edition r151030bw, r151032aw, r151034w
synopsis: Weekly updates for all supported releases
---
OmniOS weekly releases for w/c 5th of October 2020 are now available.

* For all supported OmniOS releases, `pkg` has been enhanced to allow
  for more detailed diagnostic messages via `-vv` in the event that
  an upgrade solution can't be found.

With IPS, it's possible to get a situation where an upgrade cannot
be performed and the error message is not very informative, for example:

```
r151034% pfexec pkg update -nv
Creating Plan (Running solver): |
pkg update: No solution was found to satisfy constraints
No solution found to update to latest available versions.
This may indicate an overly constrained set of packages are installed.

latest incorporations:

  pkg://omnios/incorporation/jeos/omnios-userland@11,5.11-151036.0:20201002T072614Z

Dependency analysis is unable to determine the cause.
Try specifying expected versions to obtain more detailed error messages.
```

This change adds a new behaviour when -v is provided a second time,
which shows a better error message that should point directly to the problem

```
r151034% pfexec pkg update -nvv
