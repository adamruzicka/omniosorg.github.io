OmniOSce v11 r151046 is out!

On the 1st of May 2023, the OmniOSce Association has released a new stable
version of OmniOS - The Open Source Enterprise Server OS. The release comes
with many tool updates, brand-new features and additional hardware support. For
details see the [release notes](https://omnios.org/rn/r46).

Note, that r151042 is now end-of-life. You should upgrade to r151046 to stay on
a supported track. r46 is an LTS release with support until May 2026.

For anyone who tracks LTS releases, the previous LTS - r151038 - now enters its
last year. You should plan to upgrade to r151046 during the next twelve months
for continued support.

OmniOS is fully Open Source and free. Nevertheless, it takes a lot of time and
money to keep maintaining a full-blown operating system distribution. Our
statistics show that there are almost 2'000 active installations of OmniOS
while fewer than 20 people send regular contributions. If your organization
uses OmniOS based servers, please consider becoming a regular
[patron](https://omnios.org/patron) or taking out a
[support contract](https://omnios.org/invoice).
