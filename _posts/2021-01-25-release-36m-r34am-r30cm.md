OmniOS weekly releases for w/c 25th of January 2021 are now available.

## All supported OmniOS releases have been updated with the following changes:

### Features

* Support for secure RPC for the Netlogon protocol between OmniOS systems
  and Microsoft Active Directory servers. This is required to fully mitigate
  CVE-2020-1472, and will shortly be enforced by Windows domain controllers.

### Security Fixes

* It was possible for an unprivileged user, including one in a zone, to cause
  the system to panic.

* `socat` updated to fix a potential heap based buffer overflow.

* `sudo` updated to fix
  [CVE-2021-3156](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3156)

### Other Changes

* On r151036 only, OpenJDK 11 now bundles several core fonts and has been
  updated to 11.0.10+9.

* OpenJDK 8 has been updated to 1.8.282-b08

* `gcc` has been updated so that the `-z assert-deflib` linker option works
  correctly for 64-bit objects.

* ZFS `list -t bookmark` was not working for zvols.

* Add support for the `IA32_FEATURE_CONTROL` MSR in bhyve. This improves
  support for some guest operating systems.

* `pkg apply-hot-fix` could produce error messages during operation.
