---

OmniOSce v11 r151042 is out now!

On the 2nd of May 2022, the OmniOSce Association has released a new stable
version of OmniOS - The Open Source Enterprise Server OS. The new release comes
with many tool updates, brand-new features and additional hardware support. For
details see the [release notes](https://omnios.org/rn/r42).

**Note, that r151030 LTS is now end-of-life.**
You should upgrade to r151038 to stay on a supported long-term-support track.

OmniOS is fully Open Source and free. Nevertheless, it takes a lot of time and
money to keep maintaining a full-blown operating system distribution. Our
statistics show that there are almost 2'000 active installations of OmniOS
while fewer than 20 people send regular contributions. If your organization
uses OmniOS based servers, please consider becoming a regular patron or taking
out a support contract.
