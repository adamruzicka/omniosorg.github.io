### First backport update for r151038

We have backported a number of fixes and improvements to the r151038 LTS
release this week as shown below.

* The bhyve hypervisor and the bhyve branded zone have received several updates
  that enable running with fewer resources and fewer privileges than before.

* bhyve VNC sessions are now named based on the underlying virtual machine name
  rather than always being called "bhyve".

* Additional network backends are available for bhyve, including an emulated
  `e1000` interface type.

* SMB3 encryption no longer breaks MacOS Big Sur clients.

* Fixes for kernel FPU use.

* The ZFS ARC algorithm has been adjusted to restore memory pressure;
  see [illumos issue 13766](https://www.illumos.org/issues/13766).

* Several ZFS L2ARC fixes and improvements have been incorporated.

* The ZFS `zdb` command could crash when processing RAIDZ pools, this has
  been resolved.

* The `segkpsize` tunable can now be adjusted using the `eeprom` command - see
  [eeprom(1M)](https://man.omnios.org/eeprom.1m).

* Improvements to the native C++ and rust demangling library.

* The CDP daemon (in.cdpd) now runs with reduced privileges;

* `zpool list -vp` now shows parsable sizes in all fields.

* `nvmeadm` now supports parsable output; see
  [nvmeadm(1M)](https://man.omnios.org/nvmeadm.1m)

* `profiles -l` could crash when an LDAP backend was in use, this has been
  resolved.
