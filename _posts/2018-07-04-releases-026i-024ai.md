are now available.

Weekly releases for w/c 2nd of July 2018.

* Mozilla NSS has been updated to version 3.38.
* Added support for recursive `pkg set-publisher` operations via `-r` flag.

Additionally, in r151026i

* Kernel update to protect against the Lazy FPU vulnerability
  * [CVE-2018-3665](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2018-3665)
* New `::sec` mdb command to summarise protection against CPU vulnerabilities
* Fix problem when using native grep with context arguments (-A, -B, -C)

Lazy FPU vulnerabilities. Please see
